# copilot

This repository packages the Copilot language server into standalone binaries that don't require Node to be installed on the user machine.

To publish a new release of the Copilot language server, create a new git tag e.g. `v1.2.3` and push it. A draft release will be created automatically. Once you publish it, Zed users will download the updated server the first time they use Copilot.
